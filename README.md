This is a JavaScript class project, a collection of 3 shape-based minigames.

* [The Trapezoid Game](http://thomasmiles.ml/pages/level1.html) - The goal is to make a big trapezoid using smaller trapezoids
* [The Shape-Cutting Game](http://thomasmiles.ml/pages/level2.html) - The goal is to divide a given polygon into a given number of polygons with a limited number of tries.
* [The Shape-Cutting Game II](in development) - The goal is to divide a given polygon a specified number of times so that the new polygons have the same area
